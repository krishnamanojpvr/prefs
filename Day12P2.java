/*
You are given a list of Student objects, where each Student has the following fields:
	name (String): The name of the student
	subject (String): The subject the student is studying
	grade (double): The studentâ€™s grade
	school (String): The school the student belongs to

Tasks to Perform:
	Filter: Select students with a grade greater than 75.
	Map: Add 5 points bonus to their grades.
	GroupBy: Group the students by their school.
	Reduce/Aggregate: Calculate the average grade for each school.
	Aggregator: Identify the student with the highest grade in each school.


Sample Input:
-------------
5					// number of students
Alice Math 80 HPS	// each student infomation.
Bob Science 60 DPS 
Charlie Math 75 HPS
David Science 85 DPS 
Eva Math 95 HPS
	
Sample Output:
--------------
HPS: Eva with grade 100.0
DPS: David with grade 90.0
