/*Mr. Febin is studying numbers with unique properties and is interested in 
finding all AD Numbers within a specified range.

An AD Number is a number where every pair of adjacent digits has an absolute 
difference of exactly 1.

Given two integers, start and end, identify all AD Numbers within the inclusive 
range [start,end] and output them in ascending order.

Constraints:
------------
0 <= start < end <2*10^9.
 
Input Format:
-------------
Two space-separated integers, start and end, representing the range.

Output Format:
--------------
A list of integers showing all AD Numbers in the given range.


Sample Input-1:
---------------
0 15

Sample Output-1:
----------------
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12]

Explanation:
------------
All numbers in this list have adjacent digits differing by exactly 1.


Sample Input-2:
---------------
25 65

Sample Output-2:
----------------
[32, 34, 43, 45, 54, 56, 65]
